A discord bot to send the contents of a given file to a given channel

To start, just add your token, desired channel, banner (optional), and filename to .env.example and **rename it to .env**

Using !send in the channel (defined in .env) will clear *all* messages in said channel and replace them with the contents of the provided file, preceded by the banner.
